Konrad Turek had the pleasure of speaking with Sage Research Methods about open science, open-source knowledge production and the Comparative Panel File (CPF) Open Harmonization Project.

In this video, Konrad discusses:
 ðŸ”¹ The "production" side of open science 
 ðŸ”¹ How open-source models are shaping social science research
 ðŸ”¹ The goals and progress of the CPF harmonization initiative
 ðŸ”¹ Key advantagesâ€”and challengesâ€”of collaborative, transparent data work

Open-source science is reshaping how we collaborate and innovateâ€”making research faster, more flexible, and better equipped to tackle complex societal challenges.

Unfortunately (and surprisingly), the <ins>[full interview](https://lnkd.in/e4McXwa2)</ins> is behind a paywall for now.

But for more information, you can also check this <ins>[open article ](https://lnkd.in/emyZN_HV )</ins> that discusses these things in detail:
