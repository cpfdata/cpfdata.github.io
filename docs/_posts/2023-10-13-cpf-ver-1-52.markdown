I added several useful varialbes to the main code at Github. This latest version can be downladed from Github directly or from this CPF website (Downloads):

- kidsn_hh_02 “Number of Children in HH aged 0-2”
- kidsn_hh_34 “Number of Children in HH aged 3-4”
- kidsn_hh_04 “Number of Children in HH aged 0-4”
- kidsn_hh_59 “Number of Children in HH aged 5-9”
- kids_hh_04 “Any children in HH aged 0-4?”
- kidsown_04 “Any own children aged 0-4?”
- youngest_hh “Age of the youngest HH member”
- oldern_hh70 “Number of people in HH aged 70+”
- oldern_hh80 “Number of people in HH aged 80+”

For example, kids_hh_04:


Not all of the new variables could have been harmonized across all countries.

Enjoy,
