We are happy to announce that the beta version of CPF 2.0 (still in testing phase) has been released!

It is availible to download **[here](https://cpfdata.com/download/)** and at **[GitHub](https://github.com/cpfdata)**. 

1.	The CPF version 2.0 encompasses up to 43 waves (between 1968 and 2024), combines data from seven countries, and comprises approximately 3 million observations from more than 400,000 respondents.

2.	The LISS panel from the Netherlands was added, offering high-quality annual data across diverse life domains. This was done in collaboration with Priscilla Zhang from Centrdata (the authors of the LISS survey).

3.	The Russian part of the project (RLMS) has been excluded from CPF v2.0 in response to Russiaâ€™s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 

4.	The code was adjusted to include the latest available waves (data collected up to 2023 and 2024) 

5.	The CPF code was improved with a more transparent syntax structure and some modifications to the harmonization code (based on the team evaluation and users' suggestions). T

More information is availible in the **[Manual](https://github.com/cpfdata/CPF-Documentation/blob/main/CPF2.0_Manual_v1_250724)** and **[Codebook](https://github.com/cpfdata/CPF-Documentation/blob/main/CPF2.0_Codebook_v1_250724.pdf)**. 

The development of this version was supported by a grant from the NWO (The Dutch Research Council) Open Science Fund (grant ID OSF23.2.017).
