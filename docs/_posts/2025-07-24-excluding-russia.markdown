Starting with CPF 2.0, the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) data has been excluded from the CPF harmonized cross-country dataset. 

This decision is a direct response to the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022—a brutal act of aggression that constitutes a grave violation of international law and human rights. In line with international academic principles and ethical responsibility, we have chosen not to include data from the Russian Federation in CPF’s collaborative scientific infrastructure. This applies irrespective of where the data are used or by whom. The Comparative Panel File is an open science project grounded in the values of transparency, peaceful cooperation, and solidarity among nations. We stand firmly with Ukraine and with the global scientific community that condemns authoritarian violence, the targeting of civilians, and the suppression of democratic freedoms.

While RLMS data remain technically supported within the CPF codebase for legacy purposes, they are no longer part of the default configuration and will not be updated beyond CPF version 1.5 (based on data up to 2021). Users who wish to include RLMS data for valid academic purposes may do so by manually modifying the survey selection parameters in the configuration files.

The CPF 2.0 release continues to provide comprehensive harmonized panel data from Australia (HILDA), Korea (KLIPS), United States (PSID), Switzerland (SHP), Germany (SOEP), United Kingdom (UKHLS), and the Netherlands (LISS).
