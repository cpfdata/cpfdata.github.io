We are deeply honoured to receive the first-ever <ins>[ODISSEI Open Science Award](https://odissei-data.nl/2025/06/26/call-for-nominations-odissei-open-science-award-2025/)</ins> for the Comparative Panel File (CPF) Open Harmonization.
CPF was awarded as the first fully open, crowd-based harmonization initiative in the social sciences, created by Konrad Turek, Matthijs Kalmijn and Thomas Leopold. 

The ODISSEI Open Science Award recognizes exceptional contributions to transparency, reproducibility, and reusability in Dutch computational social science, celebrating individuals or teams who significantly advance open research practices, data sharing, and collaboration within the community. 

Awarded by ODISSEI (Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations), it highlights efforts in making data, methods, and tools FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and fostering an open research culture. The award was handed over by Prof. Pearl Dykstra who highlighted that CPF contributes to a fundamental rethinking of how social science can function in the digital age.

We are delighted!
